Producing reproducible code: A DAA DS framework
================

## Introduction

Data science is a burgeoning and yet nascent field. The popularity of
the field has created an influx of DSâ€™ from disparate backgrounds - from
economics to biochemistry, and all fields in between! Its quite likely
that all DS are more generalist than other career paths to a significant
degree, not least because of the variety of skills required to be
proficient, but also due to the fields novelty that it seems reasonable
that most established DS were either joining from a second career and/or
received no formal pedagogy/taught autodidacticly.

A generalist background, clearly has merits,

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

``` r
summary(cars)
```

    ##      speed           dist       
    ##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
    ##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
    ##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
    ##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
    ##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
    ##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

![](_main_files/figure-gfm/pressure-1.png)<!-- -->

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
