Producing reproducible code: A DAA DS framework
================

## Introduction

Data science is a burgeoning and yet still nascent field. Its popularity
has created an influx of DSâ€™ from an incredible array of disparate
backgrounds; economics to biochemistry, and all fields in between! In
fact, its quite likely that DS as a profession contains more generalist
skilled individuals than any other scientific career, not least because
of the variety of skills required to be proficient, but also due to the
fields novelty - I think it reasonable to posit that most ,current,
established DS were either joining from a second career and/or received
no formal pedagogy/taught themselves autodidacticly.

A generalist background, clearly has merits, but the informality Talk
about catch up of pedagogy and teaching reproducible working

Talk about NHS and novelty of moving toward taking on DS Talk about NHS
and recent papers on data Talk about DAA and its 3 year plan - DS part
in particular - say that in order to do this are code needs to be up to
scratch

Talk about ways we can work in a reproducible way as a team Use stuff on
my website to help with this

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

![](_main_files/figure-gfm/pressure-1.png)<!-- -->

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
