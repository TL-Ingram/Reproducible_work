```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Introduction

Data science is a burgeoning and yet still nascent field. Its popularity has created an influx of DS' from an incredible array of disparate backgrounds; economics to biochemistry, and all fields in between! In fact, its quite likely that DS as a profession contains more generalist skilled individuals than any other scientific career, not least because of the variety of skills required to be proficient, but also due to the fields novelty - I think it reasonable to posit that most ,current, established DS were either joining from a second career and/or received no formal pedagogy/taught themselves autodidacticly. 

A generalist background,  clearly has merits, but the informality 
Talk about catch up of pedagogy and teaching reproducible working

Talk about NHS and novelty of moving toward taking on DS
Talk about NHS and recent papers on data
Talk about DAA and its 3 year plan - DS part in particular - say that in order to do this are code needs to be up to scratch

Talk about ways we can work in a reproducible way as a team

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
